1.	I recognize three species, those with shell ridges, those without shell ridges, and individuals with larger U/D.
	2.	Based solely on the visual depictions of the ammonites, I think that there are two species represented, a species that has ridges on the shell and a species that does not.  Samples with a similar U to D ratios would also be the same species, which accounts for size differences with age. 
	3.	The ammonites that are smaller are most likely the youngest, given that they had less time to grow before dying/becoming fossilized.  Thus, by comparing Us between similar stratigraphic positions it may be possible to determine different degrees of ontogeny.
	4.	Males are described as being slightly smaller and wider than females, therefore I think that they would have a smaller D and U but a larger W.  Therefore, U/D would be small and W/D would be slightly larger in comparison to female ammonites.
